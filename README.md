Welcome to my first Code Institute diploma project.

I have left a few of the important commands in here to help remind me whilst working through the project.

# Introduction
For my first project I have decided to re-design an existing website for the Manx Tri Club.

## Overview
The website will be a place where existing and prospective club members can come and keep up to date with upcoming events, training sessions and social activities.  They will also be able to complete a contact form to recieve further information on the club.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.
